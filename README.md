# dfrws2006-challenge
The results of existing file carving tools typically contain many false positives. An investigator must test each of the extracted files by opening them in an application that supports the file type. The goal of the DFRWS 2006 Forensics Challenge was to design and develop file carving algorithms that identify more files and reduce the number of false positives.
