There were nine submissions to the DFRWS 2006 Forensics Challenge and many of them advanced the state of art in carving techniques. Some of the submissions approached the problem by developing interfaces that help the investigator identify fragments and test the resulting file. Others collected statistical data about each sector to identify file fragments and another tried all possible combinations of fragments.

The submissions were evaluated based on how many scenarios they correctly recovered and the novelty of their approach. Prizes were awarded to the top two submissions. The first prize was a copy of the Forensic Toolkit from Access Data and the second prize was a copy of Gargoyle Investigator from Wetstone Technologies.

We thank everyone for the time they spent on this challenge and their willingness to share their results and techniques with the community. We also thank Wetstone and Access Data for their generous donations.
